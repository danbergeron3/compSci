/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
The assignemnt was to implement a pythagorean tree. The idea was to create 
a class called ptree that uses a recusursice function to draw fractual in the
shape of a tree. I was able to acomplish this by using the visual capabilities of
the sfml lib and a vector data structure.

  /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
    Vectors was crucial for me since it allowed, to create all of the visuals
    in the recursion and store them. This made my draw function very simple
    since all it had to do was run throught the vector draw each object. I did 
    not want to mix the visuals with the background work so created independent
    systems for each that where called in the driver together to accomplish the 
    task.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Describe if and how do you used the smart pointers 
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/
In each step the program uses the previous lengths to calculate the and trig 
properties to calcualte the what the new rec will be. It creates two recs for 
either side then it calls a recursion on both to work down the left and right 
branch.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/
Sfml, documentation and in class discussions with class mates who's tips 
where extremely valueable but whos names I can't remember.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
Had serious problem with size calculations.
