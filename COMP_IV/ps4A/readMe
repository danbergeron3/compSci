/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
This assignment involved setting up the a checkers board for a checkers 
game. It did not require the addition of the actual game play mechanics, 
but it did require the development of an interactive highlight feature.
so when a player mouse over a piece it the background becomes yellow. I 
was able to get all of these features working properly.

  /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
There are two elements that were central to this assignment the first being 
the vector. I used a vector to create a matrix which I used to as place to 
store game pieces which are the importent OO design for thus program. Pieces
are a class used to give each piece characteristics that allow it to interact
with thecheckers and main as its own little interphase, that builds
into the entire checkers game.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Describe if and how do you used the smart pointers 
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/
Did not use smart pointers. The visual "game board" is just an 8x8 arrray
with alternating colors made of sf::rectanlge shapes, that reamin static 
throughout the game. If the dimesions of the game board needed to be 
dynamic I would alloacte RxC and use smart pointers inplace of raw pointers

The piece matrix uses vectors rather than arrays for its already constructed
and in case i ever want to make a larger board, the matrix holds piece objects
This object is in the checkers class which is responsible for all the games 
higher operations. 

The piece class is used to construct piece objects and has the most streamlined
interphase since all the high level decisons from Checkers class devovle to Piece 
objects it contains.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
Two major prblems occured: One was a result of left over mouse input
causing input, this was resolved by creating a clearMouseBuffer function.
The second was a seg fault which occured whenever the window is resized
since this does not effect game play and the window starts of in the correct
size it has not been patched.
